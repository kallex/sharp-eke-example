Encrypted Key Exchange (EKE) example on C#

This example is quite simply and not particularly sample-polished, but there isn't much clutter either.

Console app can be debugged through to follow up the EKE-phases.

The actual implementation is going to "The Ball" trust-model, but I wanted to share this
separate part as I couldn't find any EKE implementation on C# for the time being.


Cheers,
